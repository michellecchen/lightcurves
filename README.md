# Detecting and dispositioning transiting exoplanets through phase-folded light curves
#### June 5, 2020

## Introduction / Abstract

Among the 2,600 transiting exoplanet candidates detected by NASA’s Kepler space telescope during its nine-year-long mission, some were dismissed as False Positives (FPs) by an automated vetting procedure known as the Robovetter. Such a procedure is far from infallible. Numerous FP diagnoses can and have been overturned, resolving themselves as actual Planet Candidates (PCs) upon human inspection. A recent example would be the Earth-like Kepler-1649c: initially dispositioned by the Robovetter’s Model-Shift Uniqueness test as an FP, it was determined by a team of transatlantic astronomers to be a PC. This was the focus of Vanderburg et al.’s 2020 publication, “A Habitable-zone Earth-sized Planet Rescued from False Positive Status.”

The following paper will focus on the habitability of exoplanet candidates, the automated process behind their (mis)identification, and the implications of this automation — how it should be balanced against human inspection.
